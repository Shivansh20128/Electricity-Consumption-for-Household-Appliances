# Electricity Consumption For Household Appliances
In today’s world, increasing energy consumption and its
impact on the environment demand innovative solutions.
Traditional methods of tracking household electricity usage
lack granularity, failing to provide insights into specific appliance consumption patterns. This often leads to inefficient
energy utilization and higher bills. Our project aims to address these challenges through advanced machine-learning
techniques. By leveraging submeter readings and regression
models, we can accurately predict and categorize electricity consumption by individual appliances. This empowers
homeowners with precise insights, enabling them to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and contribute to a more
sustainable future.

# Our goal
Our project aims to harness the power of diverse
machine-learning techniques to create an adept model for
predicting household electricity consumption. By employing submeter readings from distinct appliances, our model
endeavors to dissect energy usage patterns accurately, granting homeowners unprecedented insights into their consumption behaviors.


Upon culmination, we anticipate achieving a refined,
high-performing model that maximizes prediction accuracy
and provides a clear framework for identifying energyhungry appliances and optimizing their usage. This outcome holds the potential to revolutionize energy management practices, offering individuals the means to curb
wasteful consumption, trim expenses, and contribute to a
greener environment. Furthermore, our model’s versatility extends its applications beyond households, finding utility in sectors such as smart grid management and energyefficient urban planning. Ultimately, this endeavor aspires
to empower individuals and communities to make informed
decisions, fostering a sustainable future and mitigating the
ecological footprint of electricity consumption.
